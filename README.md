# Home Automation using Node Red

*Node Red flows &amp; subflows for Home Automation*

The eg-* files in the top level are examples of flows I've configured in Node Red for use with Home Automation. Many are designed to work with Home Assistant and/or MQTT device nodes. The examples are hopefully small and simple, with the bulk of the more advanced work being handled by Sub-flows, included in the [/subflows](subflows/) folder.

See the [/subflows](subflows/) folder for further detailed docs on the subflows included.

Please let me know if I've missed any prerequisites, or the documentation is too cryptic! Thanks!
